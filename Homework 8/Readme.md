The idea with this homework was to create an Android App with Android Studio. 
I created the app, according to all the specs, however I  couldn't test it bc I couldn't complete the install of A.S., since my cpu is an AMD.
As you can see in the screen shots this app will convert Canadian, Japanese or European currencies into American Dollars.
In activity 1, you select the type of currency, which will determine the exchange rate.
In activity 2 you decide how many of that currency you want to convert to Dollars or from Dollars to that currency.
